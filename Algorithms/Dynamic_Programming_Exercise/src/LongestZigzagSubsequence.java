public class LongestZigzagSubsequence {
    //A zigzag sequence is one that alternately increases and decreases. More formally, such a sequence has to comply with one of the two rules below:
    //1)	Every even element is smaller than its neighbors and every odd element is larger than its neighbors, or
    //2)	Every odd element is smaller than its neighbors and every even element is larger than its neighbors
    //1 3 2 is a zigzag sequence, but 1 2 3 is not. Any sequence of one or two elements is zig zag.
    //Find the longest zigzag subsequence in a given sequence.
